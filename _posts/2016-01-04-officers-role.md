**What is the role of the Starlight leadership team?**

**As officers** -- our role is to build the story and
direction of Starlight and its community. We are one of three pillars the guild
rests upon; Officers, Pathfinders and Members -- without the contribution from
all three, the story ends.

No matter what role you have in Starlight, you are
instrumental in making sure that Starlight is a safe, welcoming community.
Starlight as a role-play guild has two core beliefs. One is that real life
(IRL) comes first, and secondly is that in role-play a character develops.

As officers in Starlight, we got the role of
building up under this, and the in character story of Starlight that have run
close to a decade.

**Lord Protector/Guildmaster: Nomine**

Main area: The narrator in the story of Starlight.
With that it means that he keeps the overview of the guild as a whole, what
focus areas should the guild have from an IC perspective, and sets in many ways
the tone of Starlight. One of the things that are valuable to Starlight is the
wide range of role-play the guild have to offer through its members. So it is
important that the story does not push those aspects away.

He is also the final arbiter of conflict/disagreements.
"E.g the copper coin stops with Nomine".

Out of character and In character. If there is a
disagreement between officers, Nomine have the final vote.

Should be noted that what is key for an officer's
role, is also true for the Lord Protector

**Seneschal/Officer:**

Main area: An officer wears many hats, from
diplomat towards other guilds, arbiter between members, forum moderator,
motivator, makes choices on members (new and old), enforces rules, supports
members IC and OOC, acts as an RP sounding board and a more. While this is part
of all officers everyday, we are all different and there is things some of us
are either better at or enjoy more than others. 

For the officers to work there is a few basics,
outlined in the expectations document (insert link)

In addition it is worth stressing here too that as
an officers, you will have to sideline your own character, from what role you
play in an event, to how your character react in a given situation. 

Specific examples of how officers work with rules
and votes: 3 officers have to agree to "kick"/remove an existing member, 2
officers have to agree to "kick"/remove an explorer, 2 officers should agree
before inviting a new explorer. 

Based on experience, about 60-80% off the officer
work have been OOC work in Starlight. 

**Pathfinder**:

Main area: New
members (Explorers) welcome them to the guild, making sure they get their
questions answered, become introduced to other members and follow up OOCly. To
report on new members and give feedback on an explorer is ready to be promoted
to a full member. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/41c416b1-12cd-4980-912f-351e4b8b3754.jpg)
