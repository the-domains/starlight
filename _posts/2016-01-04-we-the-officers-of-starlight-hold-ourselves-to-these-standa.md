# We, the officers of Starlight hold ourselves to
these standards

****

**Holding the community** - Our key role as an officer is to make
members feel that Starlight is a safe community, both in and out of character.
 Officers always need to ask themselves "Does this situation need me to be
an officer or a player, to resolve this situation well?"  There will be
situations where we have to set our own personal or in-character reactions to
one side, so that we can defuse a situation.  We will also always ensure
that while a storyline can be negative, the players should always feel secure
within Starlight.

****

**United **- As officers we should actively share knowledge, experiences and
information, so that we are all acting from a common basis of knowledge.
 As officers we need to be frank and upfront in arguing our views among
ourselves (eg in officer chat), but once a decision has been made we will all
publicly support this as a member of the management team.  We will always
build our fellow officers and never undermine their authority or decisions by
public dissent.  We seek support within the officer group rather than take
annoyances outside and involving guild members.

****

**Role-modelling the values of Starlight RP **- for example, one of the core beliefs of
Starlight is that we seek roleplayers who are committed to character
development and to grow their characters.  Our characters should model
this behaviour.

****

**Participating **- when online on the officer character, s/he should always be
approachable IC and OOC. This does not mean that an officer should always be in
character, in a public place, but rather that s/he can be reached.

It is expected that an officer regularly takes part
in the role-play within Starlight on the character s/he is an officer with.
 Officers will also spend time on the ooc work needed for the guild to
thrive - for example, in offline discussions on recruitment strategy,
disciplinary action, setting direction and making choices.  Every officer
needs to express their view and vote when needed.

****

**Seeing the best in people -- **as officer we must never lose sight of each
person's great qualities.  We give recognition and appreciation
generously, and raise issues in a respectful way that is easy for the guild
member to take.

****

**Willing to hear criticism and learn - **we make it easy for people to express any
criticism and summarise to show we've heard what they have to say -- and take
this away to reflect on.  

As leaders we will work hard to adapt our
communication, approach and attitude - both IC and OOC to promote positive
growth for players.

**Know when not to act **-- trust those within Starlight.  This is
often the hardest skill to learn; it's important for officers to have a light
touch and to understand how to time our actions, what we do publically and privately,
and where we trust the guild to work out good solutions.
