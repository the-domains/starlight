# The leadership teams role:

What is the role of the Starlight leadership team? 

As officers our role is to build the story and direction of Starlight and its community. We are one of three pillars the guild rests upon; Officers, Pathfinders and Members -- without the contribution from all three, the story ends. 

No matter what role you have in Starlight, you are instrumental in making sure that Starlight is a safe, welcoming community. 

Starlight as a role-play guild has two core beliefs. One is that real life (IRL) comes first, and secondly is that in role-play a character develops.
As officers in Starlight, we have the role of supporting this, and the in-character story of Starlight that has run for close to a decade. 

**Lord Protector/Guildmaster: Nomine **

Main area: The narrator in the story of Starlight. This means that he keeps the overview of the guild as a whole, what focus areas the guild should have from an IC perspective.  In many ways, he sets the tone of Starlight. 

One of the things that is valuable to Starlight is the wide range of role-play the guild has to offer through its different members and their individual interests. So it is important that the story of Starlight maintains all aspects of that wide-ranging role play. 

Nomine  is also the final arbiter of conflict/disagreements.  I.e. "the copper coin stops with Nomine".  This is true both out of character and in character. If there is disagreement between officers, or a disagreement between officers and Nomine, Nomine has the final vote. 

It should be noted that what is key for an officer's role, is also true for the Lord Protector.

**Seneschal/Officer:**

Main area: An officer wears many hats, from diplomat towards other guilds, arbiter between members, forum moderator, motivator, making choices on members (new and old), enforcing rules, supporting members IC and OOC, acting as an RP sounding board and more. While this is part of all officers' life every day, we are all different and there are things some of us are either better, at or enjoy more, than others. 

For the officer team to work there are a few basics, outlined in the expectations document (insert link). 

In addition it is worth stressing here too that as an officers, you will often have to sideline your own character, from what role you play in an event, to how your character reacts in a given situation. When an officer reacts with anger, for example, it is a different experience for the recipient than when there is anger between guild members. 

Specific examples of how officers work with rules and votes: 

* 3 officers have to agree to "kick"/remove an existing member 
* 2 officers have to agree to "kick"/remove an explorer 
* 2 officers should agree before inviting a new explorer. 

Based on experience, about 60-80% off the officer work have been OOC work in Starlight. 

**Pathfinder**: 

Main area: New members (Explorers) welcome them to the guild, making sure they get their questions answered, become introduced to other members and follow up OOCly. To report on new members and give feedback on an explorer is ready to be promoted to a full member.
