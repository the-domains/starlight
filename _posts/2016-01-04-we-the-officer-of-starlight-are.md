# We, the
officer of Starlight are:

****

**Understanding **- that as an officer our first priority is to
make Starlight feel like a community where it is safe to be, both in and out of
character. This includes situations where we got to set the in character views
on the side-line, so we can defuse a situation.

****

****

**United **- You are up front when you disagree and will
argue your views among the officers (eg in officer chat), but once a decision
has been made you publicly support this as a member of the management
team.

You always build other officers
and never undermine their authority or decisions.

You seek support within the officer group
rather than take annoyances outside and involve guild members.

****

****

**Changing **- one of the core beliefs of Starlight is that
we seek roleplayers who are committed to character development and to grow
their characters. As officers we to should seek to let our characters grow,
change and react to what happens to our characters.

As leaders
both IC and OOC adapt our communication, approach and attitude to promote
positive growth for players, and with the understanding that while a storyline
can be negative the players should secure within Starlight. 

****

****

**Participating **- when online on the officer character, s/he
should always be approachable IC and OOC. This does not mean that an officer
should always be in character, in a public place. But rather that s/he can be
reached.

It is
expected that an officer regularly takes part of the role-play within Starlight
on the character s/he is an officer with. 

As well as
take part in the decisions of Starlight: How and who to recruit, when to
enforce rules, evaluate the rules and the choices we take. You will contribute
through expressing your view and voting. 

****

****

**See the best in people -- **never lose sight of a person's
great qualities, give recognition and appreciation generously, raise issues in
a respectful way that is easy for the guild member to take.

Willing to
hear criticism and learn -- you make it easy for people to express any criticism
and summarise to show you've heard what they have to say -- and take this away
to reflect on. 

As officers
we should share knowledge, experiences and information.

****

****Know when not to act **-- trust those within Starlight.**

****

As officers
-- our role is to build the story of Starlight and it\`s community. We are one of
three pillars the guild rests upon; Officers, Pathfinders and Members -- without
the contribution from all three, the story ends.
