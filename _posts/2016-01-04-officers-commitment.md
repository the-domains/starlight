# **Officer commitments**

**We, the officer of
Starlight are:**

**Understanding **- that key
in our role as an officer is to make Starlight feel like a community where it
is safe to be, both in and out of character. This includes situations where we
got to set the in character views on the side-line, so we can defuse a
situation. 

**United **- You are up
front when you disagree and will argue your views among the officers (e.g. in
officer chat), but once a decision has been made you publicly support this as a
member of the management team.

You
always build other officers and never undermine their authority or decisions. You seek support within the officer group
rather than take annoyances outside and involve guild members.

**Changing **- one of the
core beliefs of Starlight is that we seek roleplayers who are committed to
character development and to grow their characters. As officers we to should
seek to let our characters grow, change and react to what happens to our
characters 

**Someone who see the best in people**
-- never lose sight of a person's great qualities, give recognition and
appreciation generously, raise issues in a respectful way that is easy for the
guild member to take.

**Willing to hear
criticism and lear**n -- you make it easy for people to express any criticism and
summarise to show you've heard what they have to say -- and take this away to
reflect on.
