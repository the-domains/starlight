One is that real life (IRL) comes first, and secondly is that in role-play a character develops.
As officers in Starlight, we have the role of supporting this, and the in-character story of Starlight that has run for close to a decade. </p><p><b data-grid-id="8caa473f-bdb9-4bd9-8da2-4c08e3c9ed65"> Lord Protector/Guildmaster: Nomine </b></p><p>Main area: The narrator in the story of Starlight.

So it is important that the story of Starlight maintains all aspects of that wide-ranging role play. </p><p>Nomine  is also the final arbiter of conflict/disagreements.  I.e. “the copper coin stops with Nomine”.  This is true both out of character and in character. If there is disagreement between officers, or a disagreement between officers and Nomine, Nomine has the final vote. </p><p> It should be noted that what is key for an officer's role, is also true for the Lord Protector. </p><p><b data-grid-id="0781e6bf-f0e2-4eb8-acd0-879ed3fc9b87"></b></p><p><b data-grid-id="7b40dca4-3672-403d-a8ee-eae64e130472"> Seneschal/Officer:</b></p><p>Main area: An officer wears many hats, from diplomat towards other guilds, arbiter between members, forum moderator, motivator, making choices on members (new and old), enforcing rules, supporting members IC and OOC, acting as an RP sounding board and more.
